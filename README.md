# NuXtractor (main/master)

NuXtractor was a tool created for the purpose of extracting textures and models from Lego games.  The only officially supported game was Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (PC and Xbox).

This repository is a forked mirror of the original (archived) repository for NuXtractor, with the single purpose of providing a download for pre-built binaries of the `more_platforms` branch ([available here](https://github.com/SirYodaJedi/NuXtractor/releases/tag/more-platforms_final_official)), so that textures from PS2 GHGs can be extracted and converted with ease (until StudSmelter comes around, if that ever happens; Lego modding developments take place in ValveTime). In the spirit of archivism, it remains unaltered from its original form, with the exception of that release and this paragraph.

### Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger

Chosen Few Software is moving onto better technologies, workflows, and projects.  That is to say, I, Yodadude2003, will not be personally supporting this project any longer.  MightyStruct will also suffer the same fate, which is a .NET only clone(ish) of Kaitai Struct.  I feel that many bad design choices were made throughout the development of this project, and its constantly changing scope only made things harder and harder to keep clean and consistient. 

Watch out for **StudSmelter**, a new Chosen Few Software project that will take NuXtractor's place very soon(tm), using the brand new **QuesoStruct** as a basis for all the binary serialization logic.  

Its been a fun run. Don't worry, StudSmelter will do everything NuXtractor could, just **Harder, Better, Faster, and Stronger.**

### Thank you!!

Cheers!
